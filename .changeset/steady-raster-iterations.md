Replace animated-raster `loop` counts with a required `iterations` total-play count in the Core and Worker APIs. Animated WebP accepts 1–65535 or `"infinite"`; GIF accepts 1–65536 or `"infinite"`, omits its repeat extension for one play, and stores finite totals as one fewer repeat.

The CLI now accepts `--iterations <positive-integer|infinite>` for animated WebP and GIF, defaulting an omitted flag to `infinite`. The removed `--loop` flag fails with format-specific migration guidance: WebP positive values stay unchanged, while GIF positive values increase by one.
