Unify React async rendering across main and Worker execution. Import the seven existing async hooks from `@boundsvg/react/async`; the former `/worker` entry and `UseWorkerRenderResult` type are removed. Results expose status, execution, and staleness, retain the same owner's previous success by default, and accept explicit revision, retention, and error-notification controls. `BoundSvg` and `AnimatedBoundSvg` now use this async path on main as well. Synchronous hooks keep their responsibilities and gain revision and Engine resource invalidation. PNG buffers are isolated per consumer.

Add Core resource version observation and Provider resource revisions. Worker preference falls back only during initialization; runtime failures remain errors. Main and Worker execution admit one job plus 32 queued requests. Worker render and measurement calls accept an AbortSignal, and terminal drain waits for physical completion. Timeout values must be integers from 1 through 2,147,483,647ms, including queue wait. A raw Worker cannot be attached again after its first Engine lifetime. Pools retain default concurrency two and maximum eight, allow only one active operation, and wait for stream cleanup before reuse.
